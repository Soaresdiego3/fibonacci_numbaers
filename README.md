This is just a small fibonacci implementation using yield keyword and than comparing unsing list().

In Python, the yield keyword is used in generator functions to return a generator object.
A generator is a special type of iterator that generates values on-the-fly instead
of storing them in memory.

list() is a built-in Python function that creates a new list object. 
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. They are one of the four
built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the
other three being Tuple, Set, and Dictionary.
