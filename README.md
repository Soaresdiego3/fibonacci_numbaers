This is just a small fibonacci implementation using yield keyword and than comparing unsing an empty list.

In Python, the yield keyword is used in generator functions to return a generator object.
A generator is a special type of iterator that generates values on-the-fly instead
of storing them in memory.

Note: in the code a made a mistake leaving comments that I'm using a list() function, but I'm
just using an empty list and append the sequence to it.
